# Command Line interface
  This is a elementary command line interface using Java, JavaScript, HTML and Springboot
  (HTML generated by ChatGPT)
# How it Works
  1. Open bootRun.bat in .\note
  2. Open front.html

It only works locally and serves as a prototype for further projects.
Was a good exercise to figure out what Springboot and Javascript is.

**Would Recommend 5/5**
